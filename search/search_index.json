This allows you to use any number of phones on your extension, control your own voicemail and many other things. In many ways, it's easier to run your own PBX then it is to try to connect multiple phones to our system. The more people who can use a their own PBX is the less number of phones trying to register to our network and helps keep resources free. 3CX is only a SIP based PBX. Therefore, when requesting a new line for use with 3CX, you will just need to request a new extension. DO NOT REQUEST A TRUNK. If you request a trunk, it will be configured for an IAX connection for Asterisk/FreePBX. We do not want that. Also, if you already have an extension on the HOIP Network, you do not need to have it converted or anything. All you would be doing is replacing your existing endpoint with 3CX and then connecting to that your existing endpoint to your new PBX. You don't have to configure Voicemail on 3CX if you do not want to and continue to use your existing voicemail box provided on the HOIP Network. If you want to use voicemail on the 3CX PBX, see the note at the end of this document on steps to take. It does take a bit of work to get your own PBX configured and setup, but it in the end, the rewards are nice. This guide assumes that you already have a 3CX PBX setup and ready and have also setup user extensions and voicemail boxes. There are many other guides on the Internet explaining how to do this, so that is outside the scope of this document. Configuring the Trunk \u00b6 Create the Trunk \u00b6 Log into your 3CX PBX Management Console. Click on SIP Trunks in the left hand column. Click Add SIP Trunk . Select Generic in the Select Country dropdown. Then select Asterisk in the Select Provider in your Country dropdown. Enter the extension number/Username that you received in the email from the HOIP System in the Main Trunk No field. Click Ok . This should drop you into the edit screen for the trunk. Now give it a name in the Enter name for Trunk field (Suggested \"HOIP\") In the Registrar/Server/Gateway Hostname or IP field, enter the FQDN of of the PBX Server your extension is on. This will be in the email from the HOIP system. You will only need to put the FQDN in the first box. In the box at the end of that line, you will need to put the port in (5160). Example FQDN: pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com Scroll down to the Authentication section In the Type of Authentication drop down select Register/Account based Put the extension (username) in the Authentication ID (aka SIP User ID) field. Again, this is from the email that you received from the HOIP System. Put the password from the email in the Authentication Password field. Leave the rest as default. Click OK at the top to save the settings. Wait a minute or two for the trunk to register. It should register, unless you entered something wrong. If it does not register, go back and check all your settings. Configure 3CX Outbound Rule \u00b6 Once we have the Trunk setup and registered correctly, now we need an outbound route. This is so you can make calls out of your PBX. Click on Outbound Rules on the left hand menu. Click Add . Give it a name in Rule Name (Suggested: \"HOIP Outbound\") In the Calls to numbers starting with prefix give it a prefix for dialing. This would be a number that the PBX would see at the beginning of the dialed number that it would know to use this new route. I used 8 for mine. If you know of or remember the old \"Dial 9 for an outside line\" thing in offices, this is the same thing. This way you don't accidently dial out of your HOIP trunk if you are trying to make a different call. Scroll Down to the Make outbound calls on Section. For Route 1 select the HOIP Trunk we configured above. In the Strip Digits dropdown, choose the number 1. This will strip off the prefix we defined above and then send the rest of the number dialed down the \"trunk\". Click OK at the top to save your settings. Now whenever you want to dial someone on HOIP, you will dial 8+<The Extension> (example: 8100070 for N8ACL). Any other house type calls will not go out this trunk. If you use this for a home PBX, you will need to make sure to dial 1-800 or 1-855 to make toll free calls on your home number, depending on the number you use for the prefix. Configure 3CX Inbound Rule \u00b6 Once we have the Trunk setup and registered correctly, now we need an outbound route. Click on Inbound Rules on the left hand menu. Click Add DID Rule . Give it a name in Name (Suggested: \"HOIP Inbound\") In the DID/DDI give it your extension number on HOIP. In the Route calls to Section, this is where you set the routing for the incoming calls for HOIP. You can route both (internal and external) to a specific extension or to a ring group if you have one setup. You could also route the calls to a voicemail box directly if you wanted to. Click OK at the top to save your settings. Now Test \u00b6 Now pickup a phone and call an extension on HOIP to test it and also see if you can have someone call you. Everything should flow correctly. Voicemail Options \u00b6 The nice thing about 3CX is you can have the PBX handle your voicemail, or you can have HOIP handle the voicemail. If you want HOIP to handle voicemail, just disable the voicemail options for the extension that incoming HOIP calls are being routed to on 3CX. If you want to handle voicemail your self, you have two additional options for this: You can have your HOIP Voicemail box disabled and have everything roll to your PBX You can set your pickup time on voicemail to 10 seconds on your 3CX PBX voicemail. This will pickup your call and send it to voicemail before HOIP. This option allows you to keep your HOIP Voicemail Box as a backup in case your PBX goes off line for some reason, allowing you to continue to get voicemails to your extension.

Now give it a name in the Enter name for Trunk field (Suggested \"HOIP\") In the Registrar/Server/Gateway Hostname or IP field, enter the FQDN of of the PBX Server your extension is on. This will be in the email from the HOIP system. You will only need to put the FQDN in the first box. In the box at the end of that line, you will need to put the port in (5160). Example FQDN: pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com Scroll down to the Authentication section In the Type of Authentication drop down select Register/Account based Put the extension (username) in the Authentication ID (aka SIP User ID) field. Again, this is from the email that you received from the HOIP System. Put the password from the email in the Authentication Password field. Leave the rest as default. Click OK at the top to save the settings. Wait a minute or two for the trunk to register. It should register, unless you entered something wrong.

This is so you can make calls out of your PBX. Click on Outbound Rules on the left hand menu. Click Add . Give it a name in Rule Name (Suggested: \"HOIP Outbound\") In the Calls to numbers starting with prefix give it a prefix for dialing. This would be a number that the PBX would see at the beginning of the dialed number that it would know to use this new route. I used 8 for mine. If you know of or remember the old \"Dial 9 for an outside line\" thing in offices, this is the same thing. This way you don't accidently dial out of your HOIP trunk if you are trying to make a different call. Scroll Down to the Make outbound calls on Section. For Route 1 select the HOIP Trunk we configured above. In the Strip Digits dropdown, choose the number 1. This will strip off the prefix we defined above and then send the rest of the number dialed down the \"trunk\". Click OK at the top to save your settings. Now whenever you want to dial someone on HOIP, you will dial 8+<The Extension> (example: 8100070 for N8ACL). Any other house type calls will not go out this trunk. If you use this for a home PBX, you will need to make sure to dial 1-800 or 1-855 to make toll free calls on your home number, depending on the number you use for the prefix.","title":"Configure 3CX Outbound Rule"},{"location":"endpoints/pbx/3cx/configure-3cx-trunk/#configure-3cx-inbound-rule","text":"Once we have the Trunk setup and registered correctly, now we need an outbound route.

If you want HOIP to handle voicemail, just disable the voicemail options for the extension that incoming HOIP calls are being routed to on 3CX. If you want to handle voicemail your self, you have two additional options for this: You can have your HOIP Voicemail box disabled and have everything roll to your PBX You can set your pickup time on voicemail to 10 seconds on your 3CX PBX voicemail. This will pickup your call and send it to voicemail before HOIP. This option allows you to keep your HOIP Voicemail Box as a backup in case your PBX goes off line for some reason, allowing you to continue to get voicemails to your extension.

This allows you to use any number of phones on your extension, control your own voicemail and many other things. In many ways, it's easier to run your own PBX then it is to try to connect multiple phones to our system. The more people who can use a their own PBX is the less number of phones trying to register to our network and helps keep resources free. It does take a bit of work to get your own PBX configured and setup, but it in the end, the rewards are nice. This guide assumes that you already have a FreePBX setup and ready. There are many other guides on the Internet explaining how to do this, so that is outside the scope of this document. Configuring the Trunk \u00b6 Create the Trunk \u00b6 Log into your PBX admin screen Click Conectivity and then Trunks Click Add Trunk on the next screen. You should now be in the Edit Trunk screen. Fill in the fields as such: Trunk Name - Name of the Trunk. Suggested: HOIP Hide CallerID - Make sure this is set to No . Outbound CallerID - Your actual extension. This would be the extension for the Trunk that was sent to you in the email. CID Options - Make sure this is set for Allow Any CID . Disable Trunk - Make sure this is set for No . Leave the Defaults for everything else. Next Click the Iax Settings tab. On that screen edit the following: On the Outgoing Tab: Name - Suggested HOIP Peer Details - This is where you will set all the login and peer details.

If the line is busy, in other words, someone is using the line, it will glow red, otherwise it will glow green. This works for normal extensions and conference bridges as well as the RF-Links Extensions. If someone is dialed into a conference, the light will be red, indicating someone is in the conference, otherwise it will glow green. This Guide describes how to configure the feature on Cisco Phones and Cisco Sidecars. Other phones will probably have a different function string to make this work. In order to do this, you will need to access the Web Configuration of the phone. How this is done varies from phone model to phone model, but for most, if you open a web browser and go to the IP address of the phone, you should be able to access the Web Configuration Interface. From there, you will need to navigate to the extension you want to edit, be it a button on the phone or on the sidecar. When you are at the extension you want to edit, you will need to look for the Extended Function Field for that line and in that you will place something similiar to the following: fnc = sd+blf ; ext = <extension to Monitor>@ $PROXY ; nme = <Friendly Name> ; Where: fnc=sd+blf; - This sets the function of the button for both a speedial and BLF for that button ext=<extension to monitor>@$PROXY; - This is the extension you want to Speedial/monitor. $PROXY is a variable that is taken from another part of the phone configuration. Leave that alone. That just basically sets the server. name=<Friendly Name>; This sets the name of the button that is displayed on the phone screen or the sidecar screen (if it has one). If you are using a sidecar without a screen, this can be omitted for that. OPTIONAL: if you are using a sidecar, you can add vid=N where N is the number of the line you want to send the call out. In other words, let's say you have a Home VOIP number on line 1 and HOIP on line 2 and you want this button to speedial an extension on HOIP, you would set it to look like vid=2 . Otherwise it will default to line 1 of the phone.

Note that this does not enable Autopatch from the RF connection. This is a one way connection from HOIP to your RF system, basically a reverse autopatch if you will. All RF-Link Extensions will be in the format of 15XXX , 25XXX or 35000 . Creating an RF Connection \u00b6 To create a connection , you first need to have a properly configured AllStar Node. Asterisk is needed to connect to the HOIP system as the HOIP system is based on Asterisk (FreePBX is the GUI front End to Asterisk) as well. There is plenty of documentation online on configuring an Allstar Node, so that is outside the scope of this document. It is recommended, but not required, that you configure a private node on your AllStar Node when configuring the node to have the phone connection tie to. This will allow you to disconnect the phone connection from your AllStar node in case there is a problem. Also, we ask that you check to make sure your PTT command is setup to be *99 and release to be # in your rpt.conf file if you do not already have this setup. This will make sure that once someone dials in that they do not cause interference or problems on accident. This will also make all PTT commands uniform for the system. This should be already set by default, but if you made changes at some point, this may have been changed. On your Allstar Node \u00b6 You will need to edit the IAX.conf and extensions.conf files. In your iax.conf you will need to configure a stanza similar to this: [stanza-must-match-username] username=<username-must-match-stanza> type=user context=hoipphone host=dynamic auth=md5 secret=<choose a password> disallow=all allow=ulaw allow=g726aal2 allow=gsm codecpriority=host transfer=no In your extensions.conf you need to configure a stanza similar to below. * Note : you need to change the node numbers shown below to the node that you are having the connection dial into. So, if you configured a private node and if, for example, that node number is 1999, then you would use 1999 in place of 47374 below: [hoipphone] exten => 47374,1,answer() exten => 47374,n,Playback(rpt/node) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/4) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/7) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/3) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/7) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/4) exten => 47374,n,Playback(rpt/connected) exten => 47374,n,Set(CALLSIGN=HOIP-${CALLERID(name)}) exten => 47374,n,rpt(47374|P|${CALLSIGN}) exten => 47374,n,rpt,47374|P Please be sure you have an FQDN for your network. If you don't know what an FQDN is, please google it. NO IP ADDRESS WILL BE ACCEPTED, as they can change dynamically. Please use an IAX client and test your credentials that you used for HOIP from outside of your network to ensure connectivity. Connecting to Ham's Over IP \u00b6 Once you have your node configured, you will need to request an RF-Link Extension on the HOIP system through the HOIP ticketing system. Go to https://hamsoverip.com/ and click \"Request a Line\". If you have an account, sign in and then select Open a New Ticket . If you do not have an account, then just select Open a New Ticket . Fill out the Contact Information Part of the Ticket. Select the RF-Link Request Help Topic. Just note in the Issue Summary part that this is a request for a RF-Link You will need to make sure to include an IAX2 Dial string that includes the stanza information you setup for your node\u2019s connections in the details part of the Issue Summary box. Make sure to modify this example IAX Dial String to match your system correctly. The IAX2 Dial String is formatted like this: IAX2/username:password@fqdn:port/node-number So for an example: IAX2/username:password@fqdn:4569/1999 This is the most important part. Without this, we are not able to connect to your system. Finally fill out the rest of the requested information in the RF-Link Request area. Once your extension is provisioned, you will be emailed with your extension number (which will be the next sequential number in the list) to test and make sure that you can connect to your node.

Sometimes it takes a village to share the wealth of knowledge out there. This guide will provide methods to make submissions to the wiki as well as the process to expect when a submission is made. Goals \u00b6 Remember, there are some things that you need to keep in mind when submitting new things or changes to the wiki: The directions must be clear and concise. It must be able to be replicated by someone else. Someone should be able to take your document and starting at the top, they should be able to move step by step through it and at the end have the same thing setup as you have. Don't be discouraged if your changes or new item is rejected. It just didn't fit what we needed at the time. If it was rejected, you will be told why and what needs to be done to fix it for it to be included. Methods to Contribute \u00b6 GitHub Pull Request \u00b6 If you are familiar with how Git and Github works, or you have used Github before, you can fork and clone the wiki repo https://github.com/hamsoverip/wiki , make a change and do a pull request to submit it back. Once the PR has been reviewed and merged, the change will be deployed to the wiki site automatically. That is all you need to do if you are submitting that way. This is good for both new items and change requests. If you have cloned a previous version of the repo, PLEASE make sure that you do a git pull prior to doing any local editing. This wiki is always in flux and if you do not do a pull prior to starting editing, you will either miss updates or overwrite things on the repo. It is always good practice to do a pull prior to starting work on a repo anyway. This makes sure you are on the most current main branch edits. Non-Github related way \u00b6 If you are not familiar with Github, or do not have an account, that is ok. You can still contribute. If this is just a change request (in other words something needs to be changed or updated on the wiki), please submit it in the Wiki Chat channel on Discord. No need to format it or anything. This would be things like \"This word is mis-spelled\" or \"can you add this?\" if it is longer, like a rework of an existing document, then please put it into a Markdown Document to make updating easier. If this is a whole new item, it is asked that you make the submission using a Markdown Document. If you are not familiar with Markdown, it is a very simple way to format text files. In fact, this wiki is actually done in Markdown. Markdown makes documentation much easier as it is easier to format commands and such in a way that is familiar. A Markdown Primer can be found here . Submission \u00b6 If you are not using Github to do a pull request, to submit the file, please upload the file to the Wiki Chat channel on Discord. The person in charge of the Wiki will take it and review it. Approval Process \u00b6 Once the change has been submitted, the document will be reviewed. If more clarification is needed, changes will be asked for and the updated file resubmitted. Once everything is in order, the change will be approved and the submission included in the wiki. This process is in place to make sure we have very good and complete documentation on things. It does no good to have a wiki and have things that do not work. But at the same time, if you want to make a submission, be thorough. Go through the process of creating the documentation. Tips for Submission \u00b6 Look though the Markdown Primer linked above. Look at the Github repo (it's a public repo) for the HOIP Wiki to use documents as examples of how to proceed and how to structure your document https://github.com/hamsoverip/wiki . If you have questions, ask. That is what the Wiki Chat is for in Discord. Or reach out to Jeff, N8ACL on Discord directly (@Ravendos#7364). Please do not submit anything other then a Markdown Document. This will get your submission rejected right off the bat till it is in the correct format. Tips and Tricks Learned about MKDocs \u00b6 Typically in Markdown, you only need to indent 2 spaces for nested lists. Apparently in MKDocs, you need to indent 4 Spaces. The upstream provider for the Markdown Plugin for MKDocs has decided to die on a hill and say this is not a bug, which sadly it is. So when doing nested lists (sub points in a list) make sure to indent them 4 spaces.

Objectives of This Wiki \u00b6 In order to contribute to the wiki, you need to understand what the wiki is and the objective behind the wiki. What we are trying to do We are trying to create a series of documents describing the system and its functions. A place where people can go to get answers for questions about the system. Create a set of tools and guides for people to be able to operate on the system. A place to reference advanced techniques on interacting with the system. What we are not trying to do We are not looking to include all steps and references for everything For example, while we provide the ability to connect an Allstar Node to the system, we are not going to include how to setup an Allstar Node from scratch. There are plenty of other guides on the internet on how to do that. We are not trying to be the end all and be all for other VOIP system support. Ultimately we are trying to provide a place where we can encourage the alternative use of existing technology in Amateur Radio Applications.
